# Welcome to the Arnis Wiki

This wiki is the central place for all documentation related to **Arnis** – a tool to convert real-world geographic data into Minecraft worlds.

The goal of this wiki is to provide deeper insight into the technical decisions and design of Arnis.

> 📌 This page is a work in progress. Over time, more technical details, diagrams, and examples will be added here.

## What to Expect

- 📚 **Architecture & Modules** – Learn how Arnis is structured internally and how the main components interact.
- 🔍 **OSM Data Parsing** – Details on how OSM data is fetched, filtered, and interpreted.
- 🧪 **Dev Notes & Internals** – For those interested in the Rust codebase, optimizations, and future directions.

If you're just getting started with Arnis, the [README](https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/blob/main/README.md) is the best place to begin. If you're looking to contribute or dig into the code, this wiki will help you navigate the internals in the future.

## Contributing to the Wiki

This is just the beginning. More to come.
